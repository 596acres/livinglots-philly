        <p>Success! You are now organizing a vacant lot that we're calling <a href="{{ lot.get_absolute_url }}">{{ lot.display_name }}</a>.</p>

        <p>You will now receive emails when that lot is updated--when new
        organizers sign up on the lot and notes are added to it. If this was an
        accident or if you change your mind in the future, you can stop
        organizing this lot at any time on <a href="{{ participant.get_edit_url }}">this page</a>. You should receive an email with this link soon.</p>
 
        <p>Be aware that your contact information is now posted publicly on the <a href="{{ lot.get_absolute_url }}">lot's page</a> so others who are interested in the site can get in touch with you.</p>
